###Next Gen Sequencing 

**Glossary:** 
  
* short (50 bp)
* long (100 bp, 150, 300 bp -Hi-seq)
* 10,000-60,000 bp (SMART)
* single vs. paired end
* "Reduce representation": RNA, GBS/RAD seq, near restriction sites

**OUTLINE**
    
* Advances in Seq Tech
* Range of Applications (Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), RNAseq, ChipSeq-chromatin immunization sequencing, targeted/capture seq. (use probes that target something)) Whatever the application, probably using Illumina sequencing- sequencing by synthesis (90% of the global data).

* General Library Prep. Workflow
* Sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)
* Other Technologies
* Learning Activity

**Human Genome Project**
2001-2003

**ABI-Sanger**       
-15 years     
-1 genome   
-$3 B     


**Hi Seq X Ten releases**      
-2014

**What technique you choose depends on what your question is**  
-where is genetic variation 
-phenotypes 
-#samples 
-population v. individual 
-comparative studies  
-model or not?  
-demographic history  
-adaptive genetic variation 
-gene expression var. 

Major decision points: Length of reads, and number of reads, and distribution

WorkFlow: Extraction to get DNA or RNA, if RNA- change into cDNA, fragment sample, ligate adaptors (individual barcodes), add seq. adaptors, PCR).

Extracted DWN with adaptors and put into a lane. bridge amplification, cluster gen. labeled dNTPs build on and a snap shot is taken everytime one is added. 

"den novo" assembly"- with non-model organism.
